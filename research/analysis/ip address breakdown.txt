Looking at the list of IPs and the context of this DLL (IOTC / TUTK SDK for IoT devices, typically cameras), hereâ€™s a reasoned guess for what each IP might be used for:

IP Address	Likely Use / Function
175.41.238.100	Could be a primary P2P / relay server in Asia (Japan / nearby region). Often TUTK devices use AWS-hosted relay servers for NAT traversal.
50.19.254.134	Likely a US-based relay or cloud server, possibly for device authentication or fallback P2P connections.
122.248.234.207	Appears to be in China/Singapore. Could be a regional login or NAT traversal server for devices in that area.
46.137.188.54	AWS-based server in the US. Possibly a global relay or analytics server for connections routed outside local regions.
122.226.84.253	China-based ISP. Likely a China-specific login or P2P relay server.
61.188.37.216	Another China Telecom IP. Could serve as backup or regional relay / authentication server.
74.125.31.99	Google-owned IP. Possibly used for DNS, NTP, or analytics services, not direct device communication. Could also be a Google CDN endpoint.

Reasoning:

TUTK SDK devices often embed multiple relay / NAT traversal servers across different regions.

Multiple AWS servers indicate global relay infrastructure.

The China IPs suggest local servers for Chinese deployments.

Google IP is likely supporting infrastructure (DNS, CDN, or update checks).

If you want, I can draw a diagram showing likely traffic flows from the device to these IPs, which helps visualize what the DLL is actually doing with them.
